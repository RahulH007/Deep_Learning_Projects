# NextWordPredictor 📝

A deep learning project that predicts the **next word in a sequence** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**.  

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs, can be used for **language modeling** and **text prediction**.  
The model learns from a text dataset and generates predictions for the next possible word given a sequence of words.
